# Welcome!

## Who I am

I am a CISSP-certified security consultant looking to help you secure your enterprise. In addition to 10+ years' worth of work and training across all security domains, I have extensive experience in all aspects of application development. A professional, I can work independently or as part of a team, as a contributor or manager.

## Here to keep you successful

I have worked on projects of many scales and scopes, from securing a single product to building an entire security program. I can help you solve many problems, whether you need penetration testing done, a secure network designed, or a disaster recovery plan drafted. I can be there for the entire process from planning through implementation, or for only as much of it as you need. Think of me as a Renaissance Lego brick.

Although I am based in the Twin Cities, Minnesota (USA) area, I am interested in projects with clients anywhere in the world. Part of the beauty of consulting is the inherent ability to telecommute and travel. So even if you're not in Minnesota — or even the US — we can still do business.

Please contact me with any questions.
